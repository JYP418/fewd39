		<h3> + who we are </h3>
		<p> Blue Ocean Church is a congregation that's just forming on the Westside.</p>
		<p>It's part of an innovative network of churches called Blue Ocean Faith, with flagship churches in New York, Cambridge, Ann Arbor, and Iowa City, along many.</p>
		<p>Blue Ocean began in Cambridge, Massachusetts as Dave and Grace Schmelzer - who will be the pastors of this new congregation on the westside - started a congregation in 1998, now called Reservoir Church, which became the biggest in town and one of the biggest in Greater Boston.  Reservoir was known for being one of the most vibrant churches in the area - with rich worship and experience of God's Spirit and a noteworthy community outreach that worked with one out of four school-aged children in town - that also conected in a remarkable way with people who'd been nonchurchgoing.  This surprising juxtaposition got Dave invitations to surprising places - many of them at Harvard and MIT and Tufts and the nearby universities, but also around the country and in Europe.  He was covered by press as secular as The Boston Globe and The Stanford Magazine and as religious as The 700 Club.</p>
		<p>This unique spin on church - as being powerful and robust while also thriving in secular cities, drew enough interest that annual summits around these ideas cropped up and ultimately spawned a new network of churches.</p>
		<p>In 2013, after a year-long transition process, Dave and Grace and their five children moved to Santa Monica to explore what faith like this might look like on the Westside.</p>
