		<h3> + what are Blue Ocean churches like? </h3>
		<p> Blue Ocean Faith has become, for people and churches that are enthused about it, a fresh experience of faith in a living, communicative, active God, and an experience that seems to work especially well for people who feel at home in secular settings.</p>

		<p>Blue Ocean churches commonly aspire to be:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Alive in Jesus.</li><br>
				<p>In the secular cities that these churches so often thrive in, we’ve found that even nonchurchgoing people are not looking for less focus on Jesus, but more. They want lively worship and faith and prayer and miracles. In our experience, they’re supernaturalists rather than being skeptical secularists.</p><br>

				<li>Diverse.</li><br>
				<p>Once they leave home, most people live in a diverse world. Colleges are almost all quite ethnically diverse, as are most large workforces. Among institutions, churches are often the only mono-ethnic holdouts. In the cities we’ve come to know, most people find mono-ethnicity to be a little creepy.</p><br>

				<li>Inclusive.</li><br>
				<p>It seems to baffle the people who join our churches why anyone who earnestly wants to follow Jesus would be denied the opportunity to do so on the same terms as everyone else. The rapid inclusion of gay people as full partners in America is mirrored in Blue Ocean churches.</p><br>

				<li>Politically nuanced.</li><br>
				<p>It’s not that our congregants don’t have their own, often strong political opinions. But they recognize that politics increasingly involves demonizing opponents rather than earnestly working to create a just and thriving country. Our congregants tell us that, when other churches have participated in this demonization, they’ve headed for the door.</p><br>

				<li>Attractive and comprehensible to outsiders.</li><br>
				<p>Interestingly, our once-nonchurchgoing friends seem to want a church to invite other nonchurchgoing friends to. But they commonly tell us that many churches they’ve visited, whatever their strengths, would repel and baffle their friends.</p>
			</ul>
